# Release v2.0.0 (Membership + Counter Payments)

Date: 2026-02-05

## Summary

This release adds membership plans, counter sales, and credit-based entitlements. Booking now requires an active unlimited membership or available credits. Admins can manage plans and member entitlements directly in the admin UI.

## Highlights

- Membership plans and counter payment flow (Plan, Purchase, Payment).
- Credit ledger to track pack/drop-in credits.
- Entitlement enforcement across bookings, waitlist promotions, and admin overrides.
- Admin UI for plans and member management.

## New Routes

- `/admin/plans`
- `/admin/members`
- `/admin/members/[id]`

## Operational Notes

- Seed data now includes default plans and entitlements for demo users.
- Booking eligibility is enforced at the server action layer.

## QA Checklist

- Verify plan creation and activation/deactivation.
- Sell unlimited and credit plans at counter and verify entitlements.
- Book with unlimited and credits; block booking when no entitlements.
- Validate credit consumption/refunds and waitlist promotion behavior.
- Confirm audit log events for membership/payment actions.

## Upgrade Notes

- New tables: Plan, Purchase, Payment, MemberSubscription, CreditLedgerEntry.
- For production, prefer Prisma migrations over `prisma db push`.
